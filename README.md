My assignment here is to de-construct and rebuild the Google homepage using HTML and CSS from scratch!

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Conclusion:

Now that I have completed this assignment I can say that I am proud of what I have acomplished. It is far from perfect at this stage 
but I drafted the HTML and CSS from memory for the most part with a minor Google search for assistance on posistioning which is something
I believe I could do with some further studying to fully understand everything.
