My assignment here is to de-construct and rebuild the Google homepage using HTML and CSS from scratch!

What I have learnt so far:-

I've learnt the importance of CSS and its properties such as posistioning with such things as  center, float and absolute/relative etc.

some key demonstrated skills:-

1. The grouping of elements using both semantic and non-semantic tags.
2. The creation of a NAV bar using inline-block and floats. 
3. The various different methods we can use to apply CSS using selector methods
4. Using developer tools to properly asses dimensions and to debugg areas of the page so that it loads the way I want it to on various devices
5. The correct placement of images big and small (Some used in the Nav)
6. Pseudo-classes
7. CSS posistioning elements
